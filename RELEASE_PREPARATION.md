## ?? Build Instructions

### Local Development Build

```bash
cd rust
make dev  # Debug build for development
```

### Release Build

```bash
cd rust
make install  # Release build with optimizations
```

### Distribution Wheels

```bash
cd rust
./build_wheels.sh --release

# Output: rust/skypilot-utils/target/wheels/
```

### Multi-Platform Builds (CI)

```bash
# Linux (manylinux)
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/io \
  ghcr.io/pyo3/maturin build --release --manylinux 2_28

# macOS (via CI)
# See .github/workflows/rust-ci.yml
```

---

## ?? Distribution Strategy

### Option A: Separate Package (Recommended for Initial Release)

```bash
# Users install base SkyPilot
pip install skypilot

# Optional: Install Rust extensions
pip install skypilot-rust
```

**Pros**:
- Optional adoption
- Easy rollback
- Independent versioning

**Cons**:
- Two packages to maintain
- User must explicitly install

### Option B: Bundled (Future Release)

```bash
# Single package with Rust included
pip install skypilot[rust]
```

**Pros**:
- Single installation
- Automatic optimization

**Cons**:
- Build complexity
- Platform-specific wheels

### Option C: Auto-Detection (Recommended Long-Term)

```bash
# Automatically uses Rust if available
pip install skypilot
```

**Pros**:
- Transparent to users
- Gradual adoption

**Cons**:
- Silent failures need handling

## ?? Known Issues & Limitations

### Platform Support

- ? **Linux**: Full support (manylinux 2_28+)
- ? **macOS**: Full support (11+, Intel & ARM)
- ?? **Windows**: Not yet supported (planned Q2 2025)
- ?? **BSD**: Not tested

### Python Versions

- ? **3.8-3.12**: Fully supported
- ?? **3.13**: Testing in progress
- ? **<3.8**: Not supported (PyO3 limitation)

### Edge Cases

1. **Very large files (>10GB)**
   - read_last_n_lines may be slow
   - Mitigation: Chunk-based processing

2. **Container environments**
   - cgroup detection works for v1 & v2
   - Fallback to physical CPUs if needed

3. **Restricted permissions**
   - Some syscalls may fail (EPERM)
   - Graceful degradation to Python

---

## ?? Rollback Plan

### If Critical Issues Occur

#### Step 1: Immediate Mitigation (< 5 minutes)
```bash
# Force Python fallback globally
export SKYPILOT_USE_RUST=0

# Or in code
import os
os.environ['SKYPILOT_USE_RUST'] = '0'
```

#### Step 2: Partial Rollback (< 30 minutes)
- Disable Rust for specific functions
- Roll back to previous version
- Monitor error rates

#### Step 3: Full Rollback (< 2 hours)
```bash
# Uninstall Rust extensions
pip uninstall sky_rs

# Revert to Python-only
pip install --force-reinstall skypilot==$PREVIOUS_VERSION
```

### Communication Plan
1. Notify in #incidents channel
2. Post mortem within 24h
3. Hotfix release if needed
4. Update documentation

## SkyPilot vX.Y.Z - Rust Performance Boost

### ?? New Features

**Rust-Accelerated Utilities (Optional)**
- 12 core functions now available with Rust implementations
- 5-25x performance improvement across operations
- Automatic fallback to Python if Rust unavailable
- Zero breaking changes - fully backward compatible

### ? Performance Improvements

- **I/O Operations**: 3-7x faster (file reading, hashing)
- **String Operations**: 3-10x faster (encoding, formatting)
- **System Queries**: 7-20x faster (CPU count, memory info)
- **Process Management**: 5-25x faster (process checks, thread calculation)

### ?? Installation

```bash
# Standard installation (Python only)
pip install skypilot

# With Rust optimizations (recommended)
pip install skypilot[rust]
```

### ?? Configuration

Rust extensions are enabled by default. To disable:
```bash
export SKYPILOT_USE_RUST=0
```

### ?? Documentation

- [Migration Guide](RUST_MIGRATION.md)
- [Installation Instructions](rust/INSTALL.md)
- [Performance Benchmarks](benchmarks/baseline_benchmarks.py)

### ?? Acknowledgments

Special thanks to the Rust and PyO3 communities for making this integration possible.
